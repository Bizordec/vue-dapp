## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

yarn add ethers vue-dapp
```

Add dependencies to your main.js:

const app = createApp({...})
app.use(VueDapp)

Add the global component to your App.vue:

```vue
<board />
```

Use wallet or board from your .vue files:

```javascript
import { defineComponent, watch } from 'vue'
import { useWallet, useBoard } from 'vue-dapp'

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'App',
  setup() {
    const { address, fixedBalance, isConnected, disconnect, error, network } =
      useWallet()

    // open or close the board
    const { open, close } = useBoard()

    watch(error, (error) => {
      if (error) close()
    })

    return {
      network,
      error,
      address,
      isConnected,
      fixedBalance,
      disconnect,
      open,
